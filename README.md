# Face and Document Capture Web Components

This repository is a collection of web components for face and/or ID document photo capture with usage instructions for easy implementation into your application.

The repository contains the following Innovatrics DOT web components:

- Face Auto Capture Component
- Document Auto Capture Component
- MagnifEye Liveness Component
- Smile Liveness Component
- Auto Capture UI Component

The components can be used to develop remote identity verification or digital onboarding solutions, as demonstrated in this [demo application](https://dot.innovatrics.com/).

You can also check out the [integration samples](https://github.com/innovatrics/dot-web-samples) in various technologies (React, Vue, Angular, jQuery).

## Features

The output of all the components is one or more face / document image(s) in the JPEG format and/or a proprietary file format for safe transfer to [Digital Identity Service](https://developers.innovatrics.com/digital-onboarding/technical/api-reference/) on server for further processing.

### Auto Capture UI Component

[Innovatrics Auto Capture UI Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@innovatrics/dot-auto-capture-ui) renders an overlay over the video stream.
